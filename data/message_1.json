The marriage remains deep and alive to me, and the feeling is like \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Sweetest Taboo\u00e2\u0080\u009d- in the sense that she brought into my life amazing goodness. This was true 25years ago, thisday, and will for another 25yearsplus (by His grace; and He has been infinitely gracious). As a wife and a friend, Ona-edo is marvelous, and most importantly, she is authentic. My Golden Jewel, thank you, for being a pillar of support to me, and for the care you have given to our lovely children. Marriage is a never ending transformative journey, the morphing stages are challenging, and could be critical. Navigating through this makes it wholesome. Bless God I met and married you. As I always say, LoveU4ever Ona-edo, and Happy Anniversary. A million thanks to all friends, well-wishers and relations for your lovely posts, and good wishes.

      "content": "Twenty-five years and counting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. (long post alert!!)\nTwenty-five years ago yesterday, Okey and I said our marriage vows at St Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Catholic Church, Ikeja. Here are my very candid reflections on being married, a quarter century on.\nMarriage is hard. If there is any married couple that has not found it so, you both are amazing. I need tips.\nIn the months leading up to October 5th, 1991, as I made the mandatory rounds of my relatives informing them of my upcoming wedding, I remember feeling perplexed as one auntie after the other preached a homily about sacrifice and tolerance and endurance, telling me how important these qualities would be in my marriage. I could not understand why they felt the need to stress and re-stress this point. Did they know something about my husband that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t? This Okey that I knew, what evil transformation could possibly take place that would turn him into such an ogre, as to require these mega-doses of sacrifice and tolerance on my part?\nI concluded, pityingly, that my poor aunties must all have married men of lesser character than my quiet, dependable soon-to-be husband. I dutifully thanked them for their advice, confident that I would not be needing it.\nI had no idea.\nIt did not take long for me to discover that self-sacrifice was not just required in doses, but in a continuous drip infusion. Indeed, after twenty-five years, I would describe marriage as a never ending marathon of self-sacrifice, of choosing the happiness of the other and the good of the union, above what you want. Let no one deceive you, this is hard. It is not easy to repeatedly do what someone else wants when you do not feel like it; or to go without things you desire, when you can afford them; to sacrifice trips to places you really want to go, give up going to places you perhaps visited freely before you were married; or stop hanging out regularly with people whose company you really enjoy, good people, maybe even people that you love; all because you are now married and have to factor the desires and needs of another person into your plans and decisions.\nIn the beginning, these sacrifices might not be a big deal. You are \u00e2\u0080\u0098in love\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and would willingly give up the world for the object of your passion. Several years in however, when the dopamine levels are long back to baseline, and you do not see any logical reason why you should have to wake up after midnight, night after night, to greet him at the door and warm up a meal for him when he gets in from working late at the factory to meet a supply deadline, I mean, you are tired yourself from long days at work and long evenings working on your MSc dissertation, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he just let himself in and warm up his own meal, and no, I am not having sex tonight either; several years in when he starts to dabble in politics, and you consider it wrong and unfair and totally selfish of him to invest the proceeds of his latest business deal in his political aspirations rather than in the house you two talked about building together; that is when the real loving starts, and you begin to regard your aunties with enhanced respect.\nSometimes, you will negotiate and agree or compromise, but at other times you will have to choose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will it be myself, or the other? What I want, or what he wants? Or, perhaps more importantly, what is best for the marriage? Because every time you choose \u00e2\u0080\u0098me\u00e2\u0080\u0099 over \u00e2\u0080\u0098us\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the marriage suffers. Choose what you want too often, and the marriage will die. This is a hard teaching, especially in this age, but it is truth.\nMarriage is also a test of endurance in other ways. Living in the same space with another, day after day, and not losing your cool more than once a month, is actual heroism. Those \u00e2\u0080\u0098little\u00e2\u0080\u0099 irritations you initially overlooked in your partner will become progressively more irritating with each passing year, to the point where you find yourself struggling daily not to be snide about how loudly he speaks when he is on the phone, or the way he always leaves his shoes and socks in the middle of the living room floor, or the fact that he never throws away his perfume bottles, and so you always see four or five fragrance options sitting on the shelf and you think he is sorted, but then one morning, he comes out of the bathroom and says to you with an expectant look \u00e2\u0080\u009csweetheart, e nwero zim perfume\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you go and lift them up one by one only to find that they are all empty.\nOn a bad (PMS) day, or during a period of malice (yes, we have those too), the irritations are magnified 40x. Those are the days I give him the side eye and answer caustically \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey sell perfume in the shops\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or else go about muttering testily under my breath \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy does this man have to shout on the phone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he put his shoes on the rack\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and Elo, the perceptive peacemaker will say \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe he has a bad connection\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cMummy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the shoes. But Mummy, are you stressed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTruth is, at some point, you have to give up on who you would like your spouse to be, and focus on accepting and embracing who they are, smelly socks and all. Until you get to this point, you are loving an illusion, not your spouse. Mind you, who they are today may be quite different from who they will be a few years down the line, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just mean physically (but yes, that too\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 middle age spread, beer gut, body parts going south, pattern baldness etc). We all change as we grow older, some of us more radically than others. I am certainly a very different person today from the sheltered and shy twenty-two year old that Okey cradle-snatched all those years ago. He thought he was getting a nice, quiet, homely Igbo girl, and ended up with a quietly stubborn, impulsive and unpredictable feminist. I laugh sometimes, at the bemused look on his face when I express my very liberal views about issues on which he is ultraconservative, or when I announce some momentous decision I have taken on the spur of the moment. I am humbled by how constant he has remained in his devotion to me in spite of my quirkiness. I guess God knew that I needed an anchor.\nMarriage is tough. But it is also an opportunity to grow in virtue. If you are reflective, marriage will show you how selfish you really are. And if you are open to God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grace, marriage will teach you, one day at a time, how to live less and less for yourself and more and more for the other. Twenty-five years on, I am still struggling. Thankfully, I have been blessed with a partner that is deeply committed to the marriage, and is also struggling to make the sacrifices I demand of him. We would never have lasted this long if it were not so.\nAnd there has been great joy too. Five wonderful children, years of parenting, children progressing steadily from milestone to milestone, house moves, job changes and promotions, business successes after business failures, numerous trips together, happy times with family and friends....thousands and thousands of heartwarming shared moments. We have built a story together, and it would not be so beautiful if it were easy. And so with all that has been, I can stand today and say from the heart that I am truly grateful we are still together, and that we are still smiling, and talking, and sharing, and yes, loving.\nYesterday we were at Mass to renew our vows. A good practice. I highly recommend it to all couples who have been married for a while. To be honest, twenty-five years ago I had no idea what it meant to love in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, riches and poverty etc. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even recall the actual vow-taking. I was probably more focused on holding my bouquet right, so that my manicured nails would show in the photographs, and whispering to the bridesmaids to adjust the train of my wedding dress.\nThis time, as I repeated the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise to love and cherish you in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, in poverty and in riches, all the days of my life\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I was fully present. I said the words with butterflies in my stomach, realizing that I am only just beginning to grasp what they might mean. To be honest, even as I am shouting that marriage is hard, I recognize that Okey and I have not yet even been called upon to endure really grave hard times, serious sickness, or poverty. God has been exceedingly gracious. Still, I said the words in faith, believing that God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grace will be sufficient to cope with what the future may bring.\nHappy Anniversary to us. Thanks Okey for being a true lover and friend. Thank you Olive, Ojay, Kene, Akachukwu and Elo for being the best children in the world. And thank you to all those that have been there for us in various ways these twenty-five years. God bless you all.",

      "content": "If there's one thing I've gathered from our entire dealings with each other, it's that you're selfish and you've always done what's best for you, as opposed to us. You've always felt like you were better off solo, but then you'd come back???? You've always done things your own way and at your own time. Which I completely get, cuz it's human nature. Altruism, however, is also very much a part of human nature, and one would expect that with love, erodes selfishness, as you love the person enough to take them into consideration, but that was barely the case with you, and tbh I don't care at this point. It's just the little things you've done, your inability to be understanding & considerate in so many situations that I can't wrap my head around. Like yesterday you annoyed the shit out of me and that's why I let you go. You really hit a nerve, if you didn't realise. Then made it about how you didn't treat me this way and you fed me when I came to see you. Like??? And I knew you would compare visits. I get it - you were hungry, but I was busy, I hadn't eaten myself, you could have exercised a little more patience. I'm not even going to go into this because I don't feel bad about not being well-stocked to feed someone who let me know a day before he was coming, and called it off cuz I'd be busy, after which he called it back on when the day arrived - it's too much to unpack, but it's not too hard to see why such an impromptu visit will mean one is unprepared to host a guest. \n\nANYWAY, I just want to let you know that you've been selfish for so long and now it's time for me to do the same. Now it's time for me to put myself first, because if not, what am I doing? What am I putting first? Definitely not an us, as that doesn't exist. Fuck love and fuck everything I've felt for you because it's caused me more hurt than any other thing. I don't regret it though, I don't regret anything at all. I've just looked back at how my emotions for you have gotten in the way of my logical thinking in so many respects; how I've always followed my heart for you & how it's never led me to a happy place. I'm finally able to try & get over you and yesterday you even try to tell me not to?? LMAO, man!\nI've loved you too much, and I think in knowing that, you've taken me for a fool. Even when I came back begging you - the things you said to me, how you dismissed me before I could even begin. It's blowing my fucking mind just thinking about it all Daniel. Thinking about how despite it all, I could get to this cordial place with you & be at peace with it. But it's okay, because I am. Even if I kept loving you (God forbid, because a girl needs to move on!), I will never ever go back to a place where you have me, and you know you have me. I'll never let myself fall for you in that manner ever again. I've given you my whole heart, and had it thrown back in my face every single time. I've never held back in the way I loved you, or what I felt for you. And how you've failed to see and at the very least acknowledge it, hurts. This is lengthy and all over the place, but I don't care. I've sent one too many messages of this calibre to you, but none with the conviction I'm feeling right now. \nYou fail to see a lot of things from my perspective, and choose to maintain that we're just too different to make it work, and maybe you're right, but sometimes it's worth looking at things from the other party's perspective. It's really worth it. But yeah, you're right, we are just so fucking different lol. I was too lost to see it, and even when I did, I deliberately overlooked it because, love. Lmao, love. \nA part of me will always love you Daniel.. I think. But I'm getting over you, I really am, and I'm beyond proud of myself. \nBy the way, I know that I wasn't in this alone, and I know that you felt things too, but please spare me the 'I, too' narrative, because you know damn well that I have never treated you how you treated me, & I've never hurt you in the ways you've hurt me, which I am certain are of a lot more depth and intensity. Even you know our history doesn't particularly side with you, that's why when I reminisce you feel uneasy. I keep stopping, thinking I'm done, and when I start reading over I keep adding more stuff. Right now I'm just going round in circles thinking up more ways to open your eyes to the madness & toxicity that has been this relationship we've found ourselves in. \nHell, I didn't even touch on how all I've done is fight for you and all you've done is not fight for me. Danny, I really could go on and on, but I'm not trying to victimise myself & paint you as some monster. \nEven how we broke up in September loool. It was the only way I got you to reply me? And I said it hoping you'd come back & we'd work through all you were struggling with together. Wow wow wow. The way I've loved you, madness. Actual fucking madness.",

And then I remembered all your sexy dance moves. Haha. Cut it short, I decided I didn't want us to stop talking. So, I was gonna ask you why you UNFRIENDED ME! and UNFOLLOWED ME! and UNSKYPED ME! (Damn girl! Triple slam!) and apologize for whatever might have happened.\n\nSo, you're wrong; I DO care bout what's up. And no, I don't think it childish by any measure. You always have good reasons for whatever you do. \n\nNot completely sure bout a time for the Skype though. Three tomorrow might work. Figure out the what time that is England yourself :p \n\nI guess I'll catch you later then.\n\nLove, \nYour (un)friend\n\n",

I feel guilty because I realize that I caused you a lot of pain, and then just made things end like that. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if you noticed, but it was after you sent the emotion-filled text that I stopped texting or calling. I just felt too bad/guilty to hear your voice again.\n\nI guess a brief re-explanation of us here would be fit. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard this before so please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get angry. I loved you. I love you. And being your boyfriend was one of the best things that's happened to me. At first I really thought we were destined to be together: go out, get married, grow old together. You know, 'happily ever after' kind of thing. But as time went on, I slowly and painfully began to realize that we weren't. It hurt to know that: trust me. I had thought I had gotten lucky in love - my first love was THE ONE, and it pained me to know that that was no longer the case. But was I meant to stop sending you nice texts? Or stop thinking hard about gifts to give you? I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Emem. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry that I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. You were my first love and that was the only kind of boyfriend I knew how to be. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you would have been happier if I started becoming a useless boyfriend (at this point, you might say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore useless\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay) and in the end, we still had to end. Then I guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have felt like you completely wasted your time with me. Or should I have kept my thoughts to myself and disagreed silently each time you mentioned something about us in two years, or ten? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I still loved you. I still love you. But the \u00e2\u0080\u0098everlasting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clause of our relationship just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem realistic anymore. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what I should have done; I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any experience. I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem with dating a love virgin: no experience. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry things had to end up like this. I really am. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what else I could have done.\n\nMaybe I should have waited when I started liking you to make sure it was foolproof. But I barely have \u00e2\u0080\u0098love\u00e2\u0080\u0099/\u00e2\u0080\u0099like\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feelings, and when I started having them for you, I was too excited/ happy to go into introspection.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insensitive. I know that. But I swear I try my best. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not that way on purpose. The way my anger feelings are very rare and faint, is the same way many of my other feelings are. So I find it hard figuring out what hurts people and what doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, since I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use myself as a point of reference. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember most of what I said that night; I was really tired. But Emem, from the depths of my heart, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. I am really really so sorry. I've cried a bit thinking about how some shit I said made us end on such a bad note. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for all the other times during our relationship when I was insensitive. Though it might not have always worked, I tried hard to adjust my sensitivity to suit yours, and I tried to make you feel like the special person that you are. This is not \u00e2\u0080\u0098my flows\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAgain, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really sorry I destroyed your heart. But you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that. Your heart is still fine. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going to fall in love many more times (hopefully, one more time). And if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as in love as he should be, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be signs, trust me. On the phone that night, you tweeted \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it\u00e2\u0080\u009d, so I guess there were signs with me as well.\n\nOn the phone last hols, in the middle of tears, I asked you if we were worth it; if, although we broke up after LJC, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still see our time together as worth it; if you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to regret us ever going out. And you said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I really hope that is still true. I feel like, although I might have sucked at times, I put in everything that I possibly could for you. I gave you my all darling. And it kills me to know that you regret it all.\n\nYou taught me a lot of things Emem. You taught me how to stay up late at night. (Remember JS 2?) You taught me how to make out (I'm serious). You taught me that Justin Bieber's songs are great (And you still owe me a playlist). You taught me that life shouldn't be about reading all the time. You taught me to smile often. But most importantly, you taught me how to love. Thank you so much. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry if it feels like I threw it all away. All the \u00e2\u0080\u0098sorry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the world cannot make up for the shit I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, but If I were near you right now, I'd be on my knees begging that you forgive me someday. Maybe not today, or next year, but someday (not the perfume). I care about you, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always wanted what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best for you. (Sorry if I sound like a dad now)\n\nI hope this mail does not sound like some lame attempt to justify my actions; I know I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wrong, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably too difficult to believe anything I say now, but you should know that I mean every single word of this mail. I wish there was some way that I could make it all up to you, but I don't think there is anything in the world that can. Fuck you world!\n\nI honestly hope we can still be friends. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to lose you as a friend too. I promise to try my best to be a worthy friend (even if my best often falls short).\n\nI love you Emem.\n\nKene",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay) and in the end, we still had to end. Then I guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have felt like you completely wasted your time with me. Or should I have kept my thoughts to myself and disagreed silently each time you mentioned something about us in two years, or ten? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get me wrong \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I still loved you. I still love you. But the \u00e2\u0080\u0098everlasting\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clause of our relationship just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem realistic anymore. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what I should have done; I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any experience. I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the problem with dating a love virgin: no experience. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry things had to end up like this. I really am. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what else I could have done.\n\nMaybe I should have waited when I started liking you to make sure it was foolproof. But I barely have \u00e2\u0080\u0098love\u00e2\u0080\u0099/\u00e2\u0080\u0099like\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feelings, and when I started having them for you, I was too excited/ happy to go into introspection.\n\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insensitive. I know that. But I swear I try my best. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not that way on purpose. The way my anger feelings are very rare and faint, is the same way many of my other feelings are. So I find it hard figuring out what hurts people and what doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, since I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use myself as a point of reference. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember most of what I said that night; I was really tired. But Emem, from the depths of my heart, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. I am really really so sorry. I've cried a bit thinking about how some shit I said made us end on such a bad note. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry for all the other times during our relationship when I was insensitive. Though it might not have always worked, I tried hard to adjust my sensitivity to suit yours, and I tried to make you feel like the special person that you are. This is not \u00e2\u0080\u0098my flows\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAgain, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really sorry I destroyed your heart. But you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that. Your heart is still fine. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going to fall in love many more times (hopefully, one more time). And if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as in love as he should be, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be signs, trust me. On the phone that night, you tweeted \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it\u00e2\u0080\u009d, so I guess there were signs with me as well.\n\nOn the phone last hols, in the middle of tears, I asked you if we were worth it; if, although we broke up after LJC, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still see our time together as worth it; if you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to regret us ever going out. And you said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099. I really hope that is still true. I feel like, although I might have sucked at times, I put in everything that I possibly could for you. I gave you my all darling. And it kills me to know that you regret it all.\n\nYou taught me a lot of things Emem. You taught me how to stay up late at night. (Remember JS 2?) You taught me how to make out (I'm serious). You taught me that Justin Bieber's songs are great (And you still owe me a playlist). You taught me that life shouldn't be about reading all the time. You taught me to smile often. But most importantly, you taught me how to love. Thank you so much. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry if it feels like I threw it all away. All the \u00e2\u0080\u0098sorry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the world cannot make up for the shit I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, but If I were near you right now, I'd be on my knees begging that you forgive me someday. Maybe not today, or next year, but someday (not the perfume). I care about you, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always wanted what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best for you. (Sorry if I sound like a dad now)\n\nI hope this mail does not sound like some lame attempt to justify my actions; I know I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wrong, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably too difficult to believe anything I say now, but you should know that I mean every single word of this mail. I wish there was some way that I could make it all up to you, but I don't think there is anything in the world that can. Fuck you world!\n\nI honestly hope we can still be friends. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hate to lose you as a friend too. I promise to try my best to be a worthy friend (even if my best often falls short).\n\nI love you Emem.\n\nKene\n\n \n\n ",

I guess we could talk dirty. Do you know how to talk dirty? \n\nAyuba:Yes\n\ntype something dirty.
