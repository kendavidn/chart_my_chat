Before working for free ahah I studied in the states for my bachelor where I graduated in 2016 right after I moved to DC for my MA and then to London for my LLM form which I graduated just last January. In April I started my adventure at UNHCR. I am currently in DC until July 18th for summer school meaning that I am working remotely during the day for UNHCR and studying at night. \nI am very interested in your offer. I will be i Geneva until October 31st with possible extension until December. \nI am looking forward to hearing from you. \nBests, \nLucrezia",
