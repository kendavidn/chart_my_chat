On the highly-anticipated set, the Los Angeles native introduces listeners to his unique, \u00e2\u0080\u009ceclectric\u00e2\u0080\u009d take on modern R&B, drawing from sources as diverse as Prince, R. Kelly, Pharrell Williams, Babyface and Lenny Kravitz to craft a familiar yet progressive style all his own. Featuring the Salaam Remi-produced title track and lead single, an understated ballad which finds Miguel joined by Roc Nation phenom J. Cole, the project is available now at record stores everywhere.",
