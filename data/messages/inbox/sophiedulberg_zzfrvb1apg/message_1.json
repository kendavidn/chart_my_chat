I'm doing well. the transition from school to summer has been difficult, saying goodbye to folks and moving and such, but I feel really lucky to be where I am and have so many friends around this summer. I'm a research intern at a nonprofit that I think is awesome in Boston. I'm nervous for graduating in a year, but trying not to think about that too much. I'd love to see you if you're around Boston and hear about your adventures in Costa Rica!",
